# DISCUSSION TOPICS

The following is a consolidation of the questions each team proposed.  Note that this is *not* an exhaustive list of everything proposed - just a high-level summary of the common themes across all teams.

This list is for your information only, to help remind everyone about the major topics that seemed to bubble-up during the presentations last Thursday.

## The Game itself
- how is it played and scored; rules
- typical duration of rounds
- demographics of players
- what is this game's genre; or what similar games exist

## The Tournament
- number of players/teams expected
- bracketed competition; number of stages expected; best out of...?
- expectations RE simultaneous play of games (how many?)
- one-off event, multi-day event, annual event
- sign-up process and approval for universities/teams/individuals
- does the website and its functions change before/during/after the event(s)?

## Marketing and promotion
- existing assets and collateral
- comparable games, websites, tournaments

## Security measures
- any details RE what kind of attacks/concerns

# OTHER NOTES AND REMINDERS
Kostin's advice

- the game is a 100% in-person, physical board game (no online play)

- tournaments are designed around teams playing around a table and spectators watching; we will not be involved with the tournament logistics, only the website that supports the tournament before and during the event

- Be aware that Juli Klie has a deep understanding of networks and computer technology; don't hesitate to use technical terms with her, but still don't expect her to give you numbers or specifics about anything in this initial meeting; same with Dave Patric.

## TOPICS TO AVOID

- do not ask about or suggest anything that wasn't specifically noted in the project overview (time with the stakeholders is at a premium; we need to focus on what they asked for first)

- do not ask about mobile device compatibility; it's assumed that all users and staff will want to access everything via any device at any time (that's just standard these days)

- Do not ask about personal preferences! Must keep the focus on *business* goals and objectives only; who they are as people is off-limits

- Do not ask about the stakeholders' experience with games or tournaments; assume they have it; also assume *you* will be doing extensive research on board games, board game tournaments, their popularity, and history with security breeches

## AND LASTLY...

- we do not have to learn everything all at once during this one meeting; we will be in communication with the stakeholders all semester (and next semester too), so focus on what was written in the project overview and ask for clarifications on things that were stated in it only

- we've been very focused on the playing of the game, and the tournament operation at the expense of thinking about the marketing and promotion aspects of the project; that's probably a mistake; I know that Juli is very interested in the PROMOTION of the game (think: brochure-ware) and how it intersects with sales of the game and the attendance at the tournament

- suggestion: everyone re-read the project overview document; you'll find it in myCourses in the "Project Documentation" folder
