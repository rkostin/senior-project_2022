## Logistics for the Stakeholder Interview
Tuesday, September 20, 2022

The Stakeholder meeting will be conducted via Zoom

- there will be no hybrid setup in the classroom; each team needs to work out their own meeting logistics; possibilities...

  - Option 1: everyone connects to Zoom on their own laptop AND uses a back-channel (like their private Slack Channel) to coordinate their discussion and follow-up questions

  - Option 2: the team meets together (somewhere) around one or more laptops; physically near each other to be able to coordinate their discussion and follow-up questions

- the Zoom session will be recorded and you'll have access to it later
- live captioning will be turned-on
- interpreters will be on the Zoom call with spotlighting turned-on

----

Stakeholders:
- Ms. Juli Klie will be on Zoom for the meeting
- Prof. Patric will watch a recording of the Zoom meeting later
- students may follow-up with Prof. Patric by email after the stakeholder meeting; guidelines about that will be decided later

----

Prof. Kostin will facilitate the meeting; he will be on Zoom and *not* in the classroom (BTW - the classroom will be open for anyone/any team that wants to use it)

----

The stakeholder will introduce herself and the project for five to ten minutes
- NOTE: some of your questions may be answered by her introduction; be aware that that may preclude the need to ask some of the questions you planned

----

After the introduction Prof. Kostin will generate a randomized order for the teams to lead the discussion with the stakeholder for FIVE minutes at a time; if all goes well, each team will get two chances to lead the discussion
