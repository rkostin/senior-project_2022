## Logistics for the Stakeholder Interview
Tuesday, September 20, 2022

The Stakeholder meeting will be conducted via Zoom

- there will be no hybrid setup in the classroom; each team needs to work out their own meeting logistics; possibilities...

  - Option 1: everyone connects to Zoom on their own laptop AND uses a back-channel (like their private Slack Channel) to coordinate their discussion and follow-up questions

  - Option 2: the team meets together (somewhere) around one or more laptops; physically near each other to be able to coordinate their discussion and follow-up questions

- the Zoom session will be recorded and you'll have access to it later
- live captioning will be turned-on
- interpreters will be on the Zoom call with spotlighting turned-on

----

Stakeholders:
- Ms. Juli Klie will be on Zoom for the meeting
- Prof. Patric will watch a recording of the Zoom meeting later
- students may follow-up with Prof. Patric by email after the stakeholder meeting; guidelines about that will be decided later

----

Prof. Kostin will facilitate the meeting; he will be on Zoom and *not* in the classroom (BTW - the classroom will be open for anyone/any team that wants to use it)

----

The stakeholder will introduce herself and the project for five to ten minutes
- NOTE: some of your questions may be answered by her introduction; be aware that that may preclude the need to ask some of the questions you planned

----

After the introduction Prof. Kostin will generate a randomized order for the teams to lead the discussion with the stakeholder for FIVE minutes at a time; if all goes well, each team will get two chances to lead the discussion

## DISCUSSION TOPICS

The following is a consolidation of the questions each team proposed.  Note that this is *not* an exhaustive list of everything proposed - just a high-level summary of the common themes across all teams.

This list is for your information only, to help remind everyone about the major topics that seemed to bubble-up during the presentations last Thursday.

### The Game itself
- how is it played and scored; rules
- typical duration of rounds
- demographics of players
- what is this game's genre; or what similar games exist


### The Tournament
- number of players/teams expected
- bracketed competition; number of stages expected; best out of...?
- expectations RE simultaneous play of games (how many?)
- one-off event, multi-day event, annual event
- sign-up process and approval for universities/teams/individuals
- does the website and its functions change before/during/after the event(s)?


### Marketing and promotion
- existing assets and collateral
- comparable games, websites, tournaments


### Security measures
- any details RE what kind of attacks/concerns

## OTHER NOTES AND REMINDERS
- the game is a 100% in-person, physical board game (no online play)

- tournaments are designed around teams playing around a table and spectators watching; we will not be involved with the tournament logistics, only the website that supports the tournament before and during the event

- Be aware that Juli Klie has a deep understanding of networks and computer technology; don't hesitate to use technical terms with her, but still don't expect her to give you numbers or specifics about anything in this initial meeting; same with Dave Patric.

## TOPICS TO AVOID (Kostin's advice)
- do not ask about or suggest anything that wasn't specifically noted in the project overview (time with the stakeholders is at a premium; we need to focus on what they asked for first)

- do not ask about mobile device compatibility; it's assumed that all users and staff will want to access everything via any device at any time (that's just standard these days)

- Do not ask about personal preferences! Must keep the focus on *business* goals and objectives only; who they are as people is off-limits

- Do not ask about the stakeholders' experience with games or tournaments; assume they have it; also assume *you* will be doing extensive research on board games, board game tournaments, their popularity, and history with security breeches

## AND LASTLY...
Kostin's observations

- we do not have to learn everything all at once during this one meeting; we will be in communication with the stakeholders all semester (and next semester too), so focus on what was written in the project overview and ask for clarifications on things that were stated in it only

- we've been very focused on the playing of the game, and the tournament operation at the expense of thinking about the marketing and promotion aspects of the project; that's probably a mistake; I know that Juli is very interested in the PROMOTION of the game (think: brochure-ware) and how it intersects with sales of the game and the attendance at the tournament

- suggestion: everyone re-read the project overview document; you'll find it in myCourses in the "Project Documentation" folder
