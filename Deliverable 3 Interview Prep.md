# Deliverable 3: Interview Prep

***Summary Notes***

The following is a summary of what we talked about in class on Tuesday, September 13, 2022, plus a few more notes based on questions and clarifications since that class.

## About the Presentation

On Thursday, September 15, each team must **present the questions/discussion starters** that they're proposing for the Stakeholder Interview, scheduled for the following week.

- Delivery: **formal presentation format** plus an **accompanying document**
- Time: **five minutes** uninterrupted presentation, **plus five minutes** maximum for questions & answers

- Attendance: the whole team must stand together at the front of the room during their presentation, regardless of whether each member will be speaking or not; **attendance will be taken**

### Rubric

The entire team will be graded together, with a single grade assigned to everyone in the team, initially.  Later, the instructor will invite team members to follow-up privately if there were concerns about an imbalance of effort that resulted in a low grade.  

Team members who were absent without a University approved excuse will also lose points as individuals.

The presentation itself (the 10 minutes in front of the class) will be graded on:

- General **presentation delivery** in terms of professionalism; this includes
  - **Good typography** in terms of the readability of any presentation materials that are used, from anywhere in the room
  - **Good elocution** from anyone on the team that speaks during the presentation, so they can be heard and understood from anywhere in the room
- **Content delivery** in terms of clarity and conciseness, to elicit understanding from of everyone in the room

- The **separate document** that accompanies the presentation must cover the same information that was delivered in the stand-up presentation, but with more detail, i.e. deeper explanations as needed
